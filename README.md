# iSH-new-start-scripts
useful packages and configuration to install whenever I refresh iSH.

If starting from a fresh install of iSH,

```sh
apk add git
```

download this git,

```sh
git clone https://github.com/AnthonyAportela/iSH-new-start-scripts/
```

change into the git's root directory and make the start script executible,

```sh
cd iSH-new-start-scripts
chmod +x start
```

then finally run the script,

```sh
./start
```

To test, try running `./lpccheck`.
